# HandTrack
Used Handtrack.js library for prototyping realtime hand detection, directly in the browser. Handtrack.js uses trained convolutional neural network that provides bounding box predictions for the location of hands in an image. The convolutional neural network is trained using the tensorflow object detection api.
